# Profile

My research leverages advanced text analysis techniques, such as supervised machine learning, to investigate how authenticity, problem construction, and urgency appear and change over time and across settings in political discourses. I also develop, contribute, and help maintain several R packages that assist researchers dealing with multiple, overlapping, and uncertain datasets across various domains of global governance.

<!-- \centerline{Interests: Political Sociology, Statistical Methods, Environmental Studies} -->
