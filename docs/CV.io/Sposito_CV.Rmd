  "This article investigates how the Amazon has been constructed as a problem in Brazilian presidential speeches since 1985. We develop a framework that accounts for how important transnational actors, as presidents, construct policy objects as particular problems depending on where and when they participate in politics
  \\begin{itemize}
     \\item Methods: We create a dataset containing 6240 official speeches by all Brazilian presidents since 1985. We train a supervised machine learning algorithim to classify how Amazon related sections within speeches construct the Amazon as a problem.
     \\item Findings: We find that presidents often construct the Amazon as an environmental problem when speaking far away from the region, whereas they usually construct it as problems of economic integration or social development when in the Amazon.

     \\begin{itemize} 
     \\item Methods: Text analysis of thousands of campaign rallies, debates, interviews, and official speeches gathered for presidents and presidential candidates in Brazil and the United States since the 1980s.
     \\item Findings: The analysis indicates that politicians usually perform different authenticities most when they are candidates or after having left office. As well, politicians often adapt to perform what audiences 'want to hear'.
