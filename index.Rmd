<p class="text-center">I am currently a PhD candidate at the International Relations and Political Science Department at the Geneva Graduate Institute. My dissertation leverages advanced text analysis techniques in R, such as supervised machine learning, to investigate how authenticity, problem construction, and urgency appear and change over time and across settings in discursive politics. I also work as a Research Assistant in the "PANARCHIC" project at the Centre for International Environmental Studies. For the project, I develop, contribute, and maintain several R packages that assist researchers dealing with multiple, overlapping, and uncertain datasets across various domains of global governance. I am broadly interested in issues related to political discourse and environmental politics in Latin America. During my free time, I restore vintage bikes.</p>
