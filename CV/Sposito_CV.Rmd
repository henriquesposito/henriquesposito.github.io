# Profile

My research leverages advanced text analysis techniques, such as supervised machine learning, to investigate how authenticity, problem construction, and urgency appear and change over time in political discourses. I also develop, contribute, and maintain several R packages that assist researchers conducting social network analysis and connecting global governance data across domains. I am broadly interested in issues related to political discourse and environmental politics in Latin America.

\textbf{Interests:} Environmental Sociology, Statistical Methods, Text Analysis, Comparative Politics, Social Networks
