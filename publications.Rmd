[**Silva-Muller, Livio, and Henrique Sposito. "Which Amazon Problem? Problem-constructions and Transnationalism in Brazilian Presidential Discourse since 1985." Environmental Politics (2023): 1-24.**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2023.2220639)

This article investigates how the Amazon has been constructed as a problem in Brazilian presidential speeches since 1985. We develop a framework that accounts for how important transnational actors, as presidents, construct policy objects as particular problems depending on where and when they participate in politics. We create a dataset containing 6240 official speeches by all Brazilian presidents since 1985. We train a supervised machine learning algorithim to classify how Amazon related sections within speeches construct the Amazon as a problem. We find that presidents often construct the Amazon as an environmental problem when speaking far away from the region, whereas they usually construct it as problems of economic integration or social development when in the Amazon.

**"Radiating Truthiness": Authenticity performances in politics in Brazil and the United States** *(Revise and Resubmit in Political Studies)*

Political authenticity, as the perceived degree to which politicians appear to remain true to themselves, is connected to higher levels of political trust from electorates and can influence political outcomes. Yet, authenticity is frequently overlooked as a determinant factor for electoral behavior for being deemed vague, and, when considered, discussions of how authenticity appears and changes in politics usually remain at the theoretical level and are rarely comparative. This article develops an innovative framework to identify and compare how authenticity is performed in political discourses over time, across settings, and by politicians. Thousands of political texts from campaign rallies, debates, interviews, and official speeches for presidents and presidential candidates since the 1988 were scraped for Brazil and the United States, where authenticity in politics has drawn increased attention lately. Among other things, the findings indicate that authenticity is not performed more frequently in election years.

**Managing imprecise dates in R with messydates (with James Holway)**

Dates are often messy. Whether historical (or ancient), future, or even recent, we sometimes only know approximately when an event occurred, that it happened within a particular period, or sources offer multiple competing dates. Although researchers generally recognize this messiness, many feel expected to force artificial precision or unfortunate imprecision on temporal data to proceed with analysis. However, this can create inferential issues when timing or sequence is important. This paper introduces the [messydates](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/) R package that assists researchers with this problem by retaining and working with various kinds of date imprecision.

**It is urgent that we look at urgency in politics**

Some scholars have argued that certain politicians sell fear, rather than hope, in political discourses. “Fear politics” embed individual and collective anxieties in discourses to defend change, or continuity, of certain political pathways against “negative” futures. Whereas “hope politics”, instead, indicate an affirmative attitude towards possible future as to justify change or reassure all will be. Both fear and hope in political discourses relate to change and continuity in constructing past(s), present(s), and future(s). By asking how discourses that “sell” fear or hope work, we can grasp with how, when, and where politicians argue for change and/or continuity when doing politics. In this article, I argue that understanding political discourses of change and continuity as performances of urgency provides an alternative approach to investigating and comparing politics over time and across spaces. I also develop a new framework and methods to study discursive performances of change and continuity in politics, namely urgency analysis.
