# Blue Jean Baby

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

I have always ridden bikes and I have long been fascinated by how things work. Once I moved to Geneva I started noticing the amount of nice vintage bikes and parts around, so I (mostly) build myself a single speed bike from a vintage frame I bought in a record store (out of all places)...

Once the pandemic hit, things started to get more serious (since there was nothing else to do).

# Frankeugeot

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

This is a junkyard build - I found almost all the parts used in the bicycle junkyard of Geneva. It is a Peugeot frame from the late 1970s turned into a single-speed bike. It is a mix and match of parts and colors, but it does look good. This bike is super fast (because of the high gear ratio) and it feels like a real vintage track back when riding it.

# Kozmic Blues

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

This is a 1980-84 Pinarello Treviso SL frame first build by Bernard Vifian, a legendary Swiss bike racer from the late 1960s early 1970s who soon after opened Vifian Cycles in Geneva. I found a used, but almost complete, 1997 Campagnolo Record Titanium groupset (and within my small budget) and could not resist. On top of I found a beautiful matching set of Ambrosio Futura wheels with Campagnolo Record Titanium hubs. A Turbo vintage bike seat from Selle Italia brings everything together to finish up the bike.

# Ziggy Stardust

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

This is my 1980 Alan Super Record frame with a set of Mavic Aksium wheels, Miche Pistard crankset, and a slick San Marco seat. If anyone ever tells you they will sand and polish an aluminum frame by hand, please discourage them very much ... but the look is awesome!

# Purple Haze

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

This bike is built on an early 1990s TVT Carbon HM frame, its‚Äô colors scream 1990s. TVT was an incredible bike manufacturer that in the late 1980s won a couple Tours de France disguised as other bike brands. Greg LeMond also won the 1990 Tour de France in a colorful TVT bike. Although this was originally a road bike, I rebuilt it as a hybrid bike perfect for commuting or going on longer rides. It is a light, reliable and fast bike that can be enjoyed everyday for the next 30 years.

# Angie

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

ANGIE is a mid 1980s Tommasini Super Prestige from my personal colletion that rides and looks incredible, a real eye turner, The frame is made out of Columbus SPX tubing and has the awesome splatter paint job vintage Tommasinis‚Äô are known for. The bike was in storage for a long long time, so it was very dirty and rusty. After taking the bike apart and cleaning every single part, it came out amazing and turned out to be in excellent conditions (wish I had before and after pictures). The bike is assembled with a Campagnolo Super Record groupset (except headset and break levers which are first generation Campagnolo C Record), Mavic Special service de courses wheelset, Cinelli stem and handlebar alongside a gorgeous San Marco Concor Prestige vintage seat. I will let ANGIE lead you anywhere it wants to...

# Lutite

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

I got this 1990 Pinarello Asolo in Italy one summer and it was in bad shape... So I took it completely apart, cleaned, and reassembled it with the original Campagnolo Athena groupset, Mavic MA40 wheels, and other goodies including a beautiful Velo Orange seat. This bike has many scars, but they are just part of its history and beauty. And, at the end of the day, it is another vintage Pinarello that is back on the streets for many more rides.

# Cadi

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

Cadi is an early 1990s Casati Monza SLX frame I had for awhile now. I finally found a barely used Shimano Nexus 8 speed internal gear back wheel (yes it has gears) and decided to build a gorgeous city cruiser. The result is this awesome bike that rides like a brand new Cadillac (hence the name).

# Roxanne

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

Sometimes a BFF asks for a cool vintage bike, so they get the coolest! Meet Roxanne, no red light needed. This is a 1985 Peugeot PH65 frame (the infamous 103 carbolite tubing). I built this bike to last with a mix of great vintage parts. The beautiful wooden rack and a recycled bike bag make this a perfect ride for city commuting (or going anywhere really).

Meet Kogamon! This is a 1990 Koga Miyata Pro frame assembled with a full Shimano 600 groupsetÔ∏è. The pictures do not do justice to how good this bike looks and, specially, how incredible it rides (it even has a custom made, vintage, race plate).

# Red

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

It all started with a 1980s Mazza race frame (Geneva based bike builder) to be transformed into a city friendly commuter bikeÔ∏è. This beauty got straight handlebars, thumb shifters, and awesome red tires. To top it all off, the handlebar and seat post have integrated lights on them.

# Bia

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

My dad‚Äôs first ever bike. This project started with 1970/1980s Mazza frame, made in Geneva. The old paint off was stripped for a bare metal finish. The bike was assembled with a period correct Shimano 600 groupset - with a few old school modifications, like a mustache handlebar and adapted shifters, for comfort.

Mid-1990s Colnago Master Olympic Art Decor frame assembled a Campagnolo Centaur 11 speed groupset and Campagnolo Zonda wheels. Should it ever be ridden?

# Hugo

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

All original 1980s De Rosa Professional with a complete Campagnolo Chorus groupset (including the pedals, straps, and water bottle). This one I bought it from the original owner in great shape, it was custom built for him by a certain Hugo (de Rosa). But guess what? We are the same height, so perfect fit for me! It cleaned up great for its' age, did it not?

# Cloclo

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

Only the best neighbors get BFF bikes! This one was built for one of our coolest neighbors from a 1980s Vitus frame and more modern components to be the perfect hybrid commuter bike (and super light), capable to ride around town or go on longer rides!

# Atalacross

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

I know I said I don't like gravel bikes and that they are stupid, but I take it all back! This is my 1995 custom made Atala frame built with period correct Campagnolo Chorus 9 speed groupset and a twist - a set of hand-built 650b rims (and long reach brakes). This allows me to fit much bigger tires and have the prettiest gravel bike around - jealous?

# Patchwork

$$\\[0.1cm]$$

My father-in-law needed a new bike (or at least I felt like he needed one) to go around the block and get some groceries. So using everything I had around the house, I "patchworked" him a cool new ride! Would you get your groceries on this?
